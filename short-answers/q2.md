# Question
What does it mean when we say something is "pass by reference" vs "pass by value." Which one is mutable?

# Answer
"Pass by **reference**" involves the address of the memory of arrays/objects being passed on as arguments. Copies of the arrays/objects are not made, so they are mutable. This means if there are changes made to the reference, it is going to be done the same for the original as well ("dependent"). 

"Pass by **value**" deals with primitive types being passed on as values and they are "immutable" because copies are made. "Immutable" as in changes made to the copy will not be reflected in the original ("independent").

# Teacher Feedback

Pass by reference means that the location in memory gets passed so it is mutable meaning if one instance of an array gets changed so does the original.
