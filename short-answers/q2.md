# Question
What does it mean when we say something is "pass by reference" vs "pass by value." Which one is mutable?

# Answer
"Pass by **reference**" involves arrays or objects being passed on as values. They are mutable, which means they can be modified. "Pass by **value**" deals with primitive types being passed on as values and they are "immutable". "Immutable" as in it cannot be modified.
