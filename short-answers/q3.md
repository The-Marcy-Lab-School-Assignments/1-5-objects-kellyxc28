# Question
What is a "shallow" clone, and why can it cause bugs?

# Answer
I think a "shallow" clone is where primitive values are copied over. Bugs can come from this because the clone still references to the original. If changes are made to the clone, then the original gets changed also. This can be harmful when we do not want the original to be affected intentionally. 

# Teacher Feedback

Shallow clone means that only the primitives are copied, this can cause bugs because the arrays from within or objects, still reference the original.
