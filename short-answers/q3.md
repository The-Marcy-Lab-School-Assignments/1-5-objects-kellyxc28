# Question
What is a "shallow" clone, and why can it cause bugs?

# Answer
I think a "shallow" clone is where primitive values are copied over, even primitive types within arrays/objects. Bugs can come from this because the clone still references to the original. If changes are made to the clone, then the original gets changed also. This can be harmful when we do not want the original to be affected intentionally. 

In addition, lets say there is an array and primitive types within an array. In a shallow clone, the primitive types would be copied over and the array within the array would be referenced to, but not copied over.  

# Teacher Feedback

Shallow clone means that only the primitives are copied, this can cause bugs because the arrays from within or objects, still reference the original.
