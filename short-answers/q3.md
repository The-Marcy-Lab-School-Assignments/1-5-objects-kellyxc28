# Question
What is a "shallow" clone, and why can it cause bugs?

# Answer
I think a "shallow" clone is where a copy is made of a variable's value. Whenever a change is made to the original, the copy gets changed as well and vice versa. This can cause bugs because we need certain values to stay the same sometimes. If there is an issue with a value's consistency, then the program can get confused, which results in a bug.
