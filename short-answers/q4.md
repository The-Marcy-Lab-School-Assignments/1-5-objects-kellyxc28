# Question
Watch this (10 minute video on JSON)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM].

What is JSON? Why isn't the example below valid JSON?

```js
{
  name: "Zo",
  isCool: true,
  age: 28
}
```

# Answer
JSON is one of the formats in how data is stored and accessed. It can be found used in APIs and configs. The advantages of using JSON are that it is lightweight, easy to write and read, and can be used with other languages. By being lightweight, we do not have to worry about the storage and exporting aspects of our code. It is easy to read and write as it follows certain syntax rules and structure pattern. Last, but not least, there are many languages that has a way to parse JSON so it is easy to use. 

The example is using invalid JSON because the keys (name, isCool, and age) are not in double quotes. In addition, if there is going to be another object, the whole thing should be surrounded by square brackets. Like this: 

```js
[
  {
  "name": "Zo",
  "isCool": true,
  "age": 28
  },
  {
  "name": "Kelly",
  "isCool": false,
  "age": 23
  }
]
```
