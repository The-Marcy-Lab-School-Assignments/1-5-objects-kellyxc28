# Question
When would be a good time to use an array instead of an object, and vice versa? Please provide examples.

# Answer
An **array** would be used when the data is simple, in a list form, and order matters. For example: 

`const food = ['fried chicken', 'pizza', 'ice cream']`. 

If we are finding what is the first element in this array, it would be `food[0]`, which is `'fried chicken'`. 

On the other hand, an **object** is used when values have additional information and the order does not matter. The "additional information" is called properties. This can be shown in the following instance: 

`food = {
    name: 'fried chicken',
    group: 'meats',
    calories: 320
}`

The first and only entry in the object `food` has a name, food group, and calories as the properties.
